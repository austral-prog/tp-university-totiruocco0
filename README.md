# 1 - Submit date: October 4th - Java CSV Aggregation Assignment

## Objective

The goal of this assignment is to create a Java program that reads student data from a CSV file, processes it, and outputs aggregated data to another CSV file. You will also write tests to verify that you designed classes work as they are supposed to.

## Steps to Complete

1. **Design Classes:**
   - You need to design a set of Java classes to represent the student data (such as `Student`, `Course`, etc.).
   
2. **Read Input CSV:**
   - Read the provided `students.csv` from the `src/main/resources/` folder.
   - Parse the CSV data into a collection of you designed objects.

3. **Aggregate Data:**
   - Write logic to group students by course and compute aggregated data.

4. **Write Output CSV:**
   - Write the aggregated data into a new CSV file named `solution.csv` in the `src/main/resources/` folder.

5. **Test Your Solution:**
   - Write multiple JUnit tests for your classes

## How to Run

1. **Run the Main Class:**
   - The main entry point is the `App.java` file in the `com.university` package.
   - When you run this file, it will generate a CSV file named `solution.csv` in the `src/main/resources/` folder.

2. **Run the Test:**
   - A test class named `SolutionTest.java` is provided to compare `solution.csv` and `expected.csv`.
   - Run the test using your preferred IDE or command line, and it will report if the output matches the expected result.

## Files Provided

- `students.csv`: Input file containing the raw student data.
- `expected.csv`: Expected output after processing the input file.

## What You Need to Do

- Complete the implementation in `App.java` to read, process, and write the CSV files.
- Ensure your code passes the test in `AppTest.java`, plus your own tests.


# 2 - Submit date: October 11th - Java CSV Aggregation Assignment

## Objective

The goal of this assignment is to extend the previous Java program to read student data from a CSV file, process it, and output aggregated data to another CSV file. You will also write tests to verify that you designed classes work as they are supposed to.

New input file:
- `input_2.csv`: Contains additional student data.
- `expected_2.csv`: Expected output after processing the new input file.
